This means that it

1. can be used to create a simple and advanced tables in minutes
2. can be modified to fit any needs

The app is built with the [pattern **Don't be DAFT**][daft] (DAFT = Densely Abstract Features for Techies), aka the **Anti-Abstraction** pattern.
So customizing it is mostly done using common technologies like HTML, JS and some C#.

## Get Started

This app is only useful if you use DNN or Oqtane. So assuming you have a DNN installation, all you need to do is install 2sxc and this app.

* Here's how to [install 2sxc and an App of your Choice](https://2sxc.org/en/apps/app/mobius-forms-v5-with-mailchimp-recaptcha-polymorph-weback-and-more-hybrid-for-dnn-and-oqtane)

* Now you can use this app as-is, or customize it to be whatever you need it to be.

* It probably helps to review the [Overview][overview] about how the parts play together by default, so you can then change as little as necessary to get it to do what you want

3. Add the necessary HTML:
   ```html
   <div id="my-table"></div>
   ```

## Customize the App

The Source Code is all here - so you can easily customize to your hearts desire!
